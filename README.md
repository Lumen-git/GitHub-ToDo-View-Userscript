# GitHub-ToDo-View-Userscript
Hides "Public" tags from the GitHub repo page, making "Private" tags more visable

With the way I use git and GitHub, typically any repo set to private is a project that needs work or is on my to-do list, while anything public is finished or in a state that it can be left alone for now. I'd like to be able to scroll through my repo page and quickly see what repos are marked private, but with how similar the "public" and "private" tags are, its nearly impossible. This Userscript fixes that by hiding all the "public" tags and only showing the "private" ones, making them much more visable and making it much easier to see what projects need to be worked on. Enjoy :)
